"""Calibrated scenario recipes for harmonic state-estimation training data.

One place defines HOW a state-estimation dataset is excited. Every generator — the
single-grid workflow, the multi-grid corpus builder and the benchmark helper in
:mod:`pgml.grids` — builds its :class:`~pgml.scenarios.ScenarioConfig` /
:class:`~pgml.scenarios.CoherentSpectrumConfig` here, so a recipe fix reaches all of
them and two datasets carrying the same preset version were drawn the same way.

The recipe, and why each part of it is there:

- **Load level** ``U(0, 1)`` of nameplate, coupled through a shared ``demand`` latent
  (rank correlation 0.5). Independent per-load draws leave the AGGREGATE of a few
  hundred sites nearly constant (the mean concentrates as ``1/sqrt(N)``), so the feeder
  never reaches a system-wide peak or valley; the zero end covers the light-load corner
  a real LV feeder spends much of its time in.
- **Per-phase unbalance** as a small perturbation of fractional standard deviation 0.15
  around the balanced base (``symmetry="small_imbalance"``), which composes with the
  correlation — fully independent phases have no component-level base to correlate.
- **Slack voltage** ``Normal(1.0, 0.0333)`` on the source reference, so the estimator is
  not fitted to one boundary condition; +/-10 % is reached only at three sigma.
- **Harmonic emission** as a fraction of the per-device IEC 61000-3-2 CURRENT-emission
  limit — the appliance emission standard, which is the physically correct reference for
  a device current fingerprint. The DIN EN 50160 supply-VOLTAGE compatibility levels are
  never used as current fractions here: read as per-device emission they are roughly an
  order of magnitude too small. The fraction spans ``[0, 2]``: the zero end produces
  near-clean loads (otherwise emission is fully entangled with the operating point and an
  estimator shortcuts every harmonic from the load level), the upper end keeps the
  measured max-THD envelope (median ~3.2 %, p99 ~5.8 % on CIGRE LV).
- **Emission phase diversity** per (device, order), widening with order (+/-30 deg at
  h3 to the full circle from h13). Without it every device injects at 0 deg, all
  injections add coherently and the harmonic voltage field carries no cancellation.
- **Load-dependent emission** — the drawn fraction is the RATED ratio, and the device's
  actual ratio follows the measured complex affine law ``I_h(lam) = A_h + B_h * lam``
  against the loading its own load draw realised: a load-independent floor of 43-73 %
  of the rated phasor (``emission_floor``) at 100-150 deg to the proportional part
  (``emission_floor_phase_deg``), plus an explicit phase slope of +/-25 deg per unit
  loading (``phase_slope_deg``). Measured devices emit 6-10x their rated ratio at 10 %
  load, rotate their harmonic angle as they unload and show a cancellation null inside
  the operating range; a proportional draw has none of it, and a state estimator
  trained on it can never learn how a harmonic follows the fundamental. The three
  ranges are the ones the composed device library carries, so Task A and Task B share
  one law; ``(0, 0)`` for all three reproduces the proportional recipe bit-for-bit.
- **PV inverter emission** with its own h5-dominant per-order shape (a load's class-D
  spectrum is h3-dominant) — the contrast that separates a generation/consumption pair
  whose fundamentals cancel at a shared bus. Spans are calibrated to the measured
  populations (certification workbooks plus lab racks, including the measured h17 bump).
- **Coherent sequences** anchored at 16:00 local summer time, the high-activity band
  (PV still producing, households ramping, EV arrivals). The time axis is one shared
  window for all scenarios, so a midnight anchor leaves most device rosters dark.

Sizes (``n_samples``/``n_scenarios``/``seed``) and the harmonic ``orders`` are always
arguments: one recipe scales from a smoke test to a production run, and the requested
order set flows into the generated spectrum rather than being configured twice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid:
        The grid to excite. Read only for its appliance mix: the inverter specs are
        emitted when it carries a :class:`~pgml.schemas.grid_schema.Generator`, the PV
        emission specs when one is tagged ``consumer_type="pv"``.
    orders:
        The SOLVED harmonic orders. Order 1 is the fundamental and is not injected; every
        order above it gets a load-emission draw, an emission-phase draw and — on a PV
        grid — an inverter emission and phase draw, so the requested order set decides
        what is injected instead of being configured a second time. A fundamental-only
        set (``[1]``) yields the operating-point specs alone.
    n_samples, seed, method:
        Batch size, sampling seed and the unit-cube sampler (``"sobol"`` / ``"lhs"`` /
        ``"independent"``). ``(config, seed)`` reproduces the batch.
    load_scale, load_correlation, imbalance:
        Load apparent-power scale range, rank correlation through the shared ``demand``
        latent (``None`` = independent), and the per-phase unbalance std.
    spectrum_fraction:
        Range of the per-device IEC 61000-3-2 emission fraction (see the module
        docstring for why it reaches 0 and above 1).
    pv_scale, pv_correlation:
        Inverter output-scale range and its rank correlation through a shared ``solar``
        latent; ``None`` (default) gives the whole fleet ONE irradiance scale.
    slack_voltage_std:
        Standard deviation of the ``Normal(1.0, .)`` slack-reference scale; ``0``
        disables the slack draw.
    emission_floor, emission_floor_phase_deg, phase_slope_deg:
        The load-dependent emission law, drawn per device and order for loads and PV
        inverters alike (see the module docstring): the affine law's load-independent
        share and its angle, and the explicit phase slope. ``(0, 0)`` for a range emits
        no spec for it; all three at ``(0, 0)`` is the proportional recipe, bit-for-bit.
    emission_persistence:
        ``"scenario"`` (default) redraws every device's emission fraction, phase and law
        parameters in every scenario — a fresh device population per snapshot, so across
        the dataset the fundamental predicts a harmonic only through the law's mean.
        ``"device"`` draws them ONCE per device for the whole dataset (``per="fixed"``):
        each device keeps its signature, so its harmonic is a stable function of its own
        loading — the relation a learner can exploit, and one tied to this population's
        signatures (judge such a model on a population drawn with another seed).
        ``"class"`` makes the LAW — floor, floor angle, slope — a constant of the device's
        consumer class (one spec per class present in the grid, ``per="class"``: the same
        draw in every dataset, whatever the seed), while the emission fraction and phase
        stay one draw per device (``per="fixed"``, population-specific): the SHAPE of a
        device's harmonic response is then a class property that transfers across
        populations, its LEVEL a device property that does not. The operating point stays
        a fresh draw per scenario in every mode.

    """The coherent-sequence recipe (Task B/C): a device population moving through time.

    Two temporal structures, selected by ``mode``:

    - ``"composed"`` (default) — a statistical device-class COMPOSITION whose per-step
      member activity moves the fundamental power AND the injected spectrum together, the
      coupling a state estimator has to learn. The composition covers the LOADS, so the
      per-device fingerprint machinery is pointed at the generators it cannot reach (a PV
      would otherwise emit nothing and be indistinguishable from a co-located load whose
      fundamental cancels against it), and those generators additionally follow a
      time-varying profile so their emission moves with their output.
    - ``"fingerprint"`` — the per-device mode bank alone: a stable signature that sticks
      to a mode and wanders around it over a per-scenario constant fundamental. Timeless;
      the ablation baseline that isolates the composed power/spectrum coupling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid:
        The grid to excite (read for its appliance mix, as in
        :func:`se_random_scenario_config`).
    orders:
        The SOLVED harmonic orders; order 1 is dropped (the fundamental is not injected).
    n_scenarios, n_steps, seed:
        Sequences ``B``, steps ``T`` per sequence, and the temporal seed.
    mode, name, step_size_s, start_time:
        Temporal structure, config name (the prefix of the recorded attribution samples),
        seconds per step, and the absolute anchor of the diurnal phase (composed mode
        only — the fingerprint is timeless).
    n_modes, dwell, mode_bank_seed, fingerprint_fraction:
        The fingerprint bank: base spectra per device, the probability of staying in a
        mode, the bank's own seed (``None`` = derived from ``seed``), and the range of
        the per-order emission fraction drawn for a mode.
    activity_scale, behavioral_coupling, cloud_coupling:
        Composition knobs: the duty-cycle multiplier lifting the population up its own
        diurnal curve (the class presets are per-device duty cycles, so an aggregate sits
        far below installed capacity), and how strongly consumption / PV co-vary.
    composition, profile:
        Explicit overrides. ``composition=None`` builds the default library at the knobs
        above; ``profile=None`` profiles the devices the composition does not cover.
    load_scale, load_correlation, imbalance, pv_scale, pv_correlation, slack_voltage_std:
        The per-scenario fundamental operating point (drawn once per sequence and held
        across the ``T`` steps), identical to the randomized recipe. A composed load's
        fundamental comes from the composition instead; the draw still shapes every
        uncomposed device.

    Returns
    -------
    CoherentSpectrumConfig
        The sequence template; feed it to :func:`pgml.scenarios.run_scenarios`.
