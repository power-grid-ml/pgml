pgml.solver
===========

Complex batched differentiable solve of ``Y(f) V(f) = I(f)``.

The solver package provides three entry points:

- :func:`~pgml.solver.solve_harmonic` — batched complex linear solve for a
  single assembled Y-bus.  Supports Norton mode (default) and ideal-slack
  Schur-partition mode, both fully differentiable.
- :func:`~pgml.solver.solve_power_flow` — nonlinear const-P / ZIP fundamental
  power flow using a current-injection fixed-point forward pass and an
  implicit-function-theorem (IFT) backward pass (real-coordinate adjoint).
- :func:`~pgml.solver.solve_harmonic_flow` — full harmonic flow orchestration:
  runs the fundamental power flow to convergence, then solves each harmonic
  in one batched pass.

.. rubric:: Differentiability

``solve_harmonic`` differentiates cleanly via the linear solve adjoint.
``solve_power_flow`` uses an explicit IFT adjoint (the only sanctioned
``.detach()`` in the codebase) so gradients flow through the converged solution.

Symmetry kwarg
--------------

Both :func:`~pgml.solver.solve_power_flow` and
:func:`~pgml.solver.solve_harmonic_flow` accept a ``symmetry`` keyword argument
(``None`` / ``"auto"`` / ``"symmetric"`` / ``"asymmetric"``).  It is resolved
**once** at the start of each top-level call:

- ``solve_power_flow`` resolves and logs the modeling summary once, then
  passes the resolved string into every :func:`~pgml.assembly.device_current_injections`
  call of the fixed-point iteration (no per-iteration logging).
- ``solve_harmonic_flow`` resolves once, threads the result into the fundamental
  ``solve_power_flow`` call (which logs once), and also into the harmonic
  injection power resolution.

``None`` reads the config key ``calculation.symmetry`` (default ``"auto"``).
For the semantics of each mode, see the "Symmetric vs asymmetric calculation"
section on the :doc:`assembly` page.
